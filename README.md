Looking for a way to find the best baseball lineup with given starting players

First, we will find data for a specific team online, we will then download this data, and modify it to simulate many iterations of a particular lineup. For example, we randomize lineup, we then move through each inning/out and randomize the plate outcome using that players stats, and we use baseball rules to determine if runs score, if outs happen, etc.
